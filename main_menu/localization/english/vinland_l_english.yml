  # succession
  vinlandic_elective_succession: "Vinlandic Elective Succession"
  vinlandic_elective_succession_desc: "Rooted in the traditions of the Icelandic Commonwealth, the Vinlandic Elective Succession reflects the unique balance of power between the Goðar and the crown. The Goðar, as the realm's noble chieftains, gather to elect the Prins, the ruler of Vinland. While the descendants of Þorfinn Karlsefni are often favored for their lineage and legacy, the law allows for any noble of the realm to be chosen, provided they command the respect and loyalty of their peers. Women may inherit the throne, though the Goðar traditionally prefer male candidates. This system ensures that the ruler is not only born into power but also deemed worthy of it by the leading families of Vinland. It is a delicate compromise between the old ways of the Alþingi and the emerging need for centralized leadership in this new land."

  land_owning_farmers: "Land-Owning Peasants"
  land_owning_farmers_desc: "Scandinavian peasants hold a uniquely strong position compared to their peers in much of feudal [ShowContinentName('europe')]. They own their land outright, pay taxes directly to the crown, and often have a voice in local assemblies, giving them a degree of autonomy and legal protection. These farmers were not serfs; many are armed and serve in levies. Their rights are rooted in ancient customary law, and their relative independence is a foundational element of Scandinavian rural society."
