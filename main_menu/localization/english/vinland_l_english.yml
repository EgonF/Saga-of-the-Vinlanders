  land_owning_farmers: "Land-Owning Peasants"
  land_owning_farmers_desc: "Scandinavian peasants hold a uniquely strong position compared to their peers in much of feudal [ShowContinentName('europe')]. They own their land outright, pay taxes directly to the crown, and often have a voice in local assemblies, giving them a degree of autonomy and legal protection. These farmers were not serfs; many are armed and serve in levies. Their rights are rooted in ancient customary law, and their relative independence is a foundational element of Scandinavian rural society."

This blending of Norse and native practices has spread literacy beyond what our homeland ever achieved."
